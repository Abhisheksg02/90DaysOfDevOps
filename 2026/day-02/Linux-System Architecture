Following are the learning from Day - 02 of 90 Days of Devops challenge .
Linux System Architecture consist of 4 layers 
layer 1- Hardware : Physical parts of a computer such as CPU, Monitor, Mouse, Keyboard Hard disk.
layer-2 Kernel : Kernel is a computer program and is the central, core part (Heart) of an operating system (Linux) It manages the operations of the computer and the hardware most notably memory & CPU time.
layer-3 Shell : Shell is a terminal in which we can run our commands, programs & shell scripts, shell is gateway between user & kernel.
layer-4 Application: Application is software program that run on our computer .
Kernel is Developed in C -language.
In order to get information of Hardware usage following commands are used Linux 
1.top : shows real-time system usage CPU memory and running processes
2. df-h : disk space usage
3. free : Memory Usage (RAM)
In Linux file system, everything starts from /. (Root Directory)
Systemd is the first process starts when a Linux system boots .
It has PID 1 
PID is Process ID is a unique number assigned to every running process in Linux .
PID can be seen from command ps -ef from the terminal
When the system is turned on BIOS basic system check happens .
Then GRUB (GRAND Unified Bootloader)Program loads and manages the booting process basically loads kernel to RAM.
Then Kernel takes the control of CPU and memeory 
Then Systemd (PID 1) is started .
